I usually travel in a car with no blue light and even my security car does not use siren or blue light. Sudden, sitting in the back seat I noticed that a car with family could not restart on green signal, an officer, I yet don't know what's his name, rushed in and single handed pushed from behind for the car to start. It just started off and vanished into rush of cars. The traffic continued as if nothing had happened. He might not even know that I captured the moment myself in heavy rush; I salute you my dear: you have made me proud.

National Highways & Motorway Police N-5 North Zone,"NOWSHERA: Four Motorway police officials were allegedly physically abused by Army Personnel who was travelling in two vehicles on the Grand Trunk Road, an official reported on Saturday.

Deputy Superintendent Jan Bahadur of NHMP told reporters that Motorway Police officials signalled two over speeding cars to stop near Jehangira, but they didnâ€™t stop.

After the vehicles were chased and caught, those who seated in the vehicles introduced themselves as security forces. The event took place near Khairabad.

Deputy Superintendent said that those travelling in the two vehicles were in civil clothes and they immediately started making calls for assistance.

More security forces personnel arrived on scene in four vehicles and roughed up the Motorway Police officials.

security forces personnel were accompanied by two army majors, who along with the other men severely beat up the officials of the Motorway Police and forcibly took them to the Attock Fort along with their vehicle.

Bahadur complained that the officials of the Motorway Police were kept in illegal detention by the security forces and were released after high-ups held negotiations to secure their release.

The four injured officials of the Motorway Police, including Inspector Mohsin Toru, Head Constables Jalal Shah and Atif Khattak and driver Shah Zeb, were taken to the District Headquarters Hospital in Nowshera.

Atif Khattak, who was injured due to the thrashing by the soldiers, said that Captain Daniyal and Captain Qasim, who were in civvies, were involved in reckless driving and were, therefore, signaled to stop due to violation of traffic rules.

He added that the two army officers rang up their colleagues and sought their help and soon a number of soldiers in four vehicles reached the spot and started beating him and his NHMP colleagues.

When contacted, Colonel Shahid of the Pakistan Army told this scribe that an inquiry had been launched into the matter. He said those found guilty would be punished as per the law.",11/09/2016,0,5,0,0,0,0,0

Police Service Pakistan,"This scene from the song #HumarayDost is inspired by the heroic and courageous examples set by many police officers who without worrying about their own life stopped the suicide bombers and saved the lives of countless Pakistanis. 

Among those brave police officers is 24-year-old police constable, Junaid Khan, who sacrificed his life by stopping a suicide bomber and prevented what could have been a large-scale massacre in Mardan.
