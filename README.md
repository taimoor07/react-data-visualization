# Data visualization App - Reactjs (CSV into Nivo Charts)

This is a data visualization app which will show csv data on charts.
I have used papaparse to convert csv data to Json formate, and used Nivo library for charts which is very easy to use and popular library for javascript.

Note: This is simple app I have done this for a software company for test purpose only. And the data is given by them.
